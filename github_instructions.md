# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since we've already initialized your local Git repository and made the initial commit, follow these steps to create a repository on GitHub and push your code to it:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in with your account (username: ClumsyWizardHands)
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner, then select "New repository"
3. Enter "adaptive-bridge-builder" as the repository name
4. Add a description (optional): "A sophisticated agent framework designed to facilitate communication and collaboration between different AI agent systems using the A2A Protocol."
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility as preferred
6. DO NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Use the "push an existing repository" instructions. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ClumsyWizardHands/adaptive-bridge-builder.git
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master
```

You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. For the password, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your account password:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
2. Give it a name like "Adaptive Bridge Builder Access"
3. Select at least these scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
4. Generate the token and copy it
5. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub

## Step 3: Verify the Repository

After successfully pushing, visit https://github.com/ClumsyWizardHands/adaptive-bridge-builder to confirm all your code is now on GitHub.

Your project is now hosted on GitHub and ready for collaboration!
