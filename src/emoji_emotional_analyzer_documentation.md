# EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer Documentation

## Purpose

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer is a sophisticated system designed to analyze the emotional content of emoji sequences, track emotional shifts in conversations, and generate emotionally appropriate responses. It serves as a core component in the emoji communication system, enhancing the agent's ability to understand and respond to emotional nuances in emoji-based communication.

## Architecture

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer is composed of four main subcomponents:

1. **EmotionDetectionEngine**: Responsible for parsing emoji sequences and detecting primary and secondary emotions with their intensities
2. **EmotionMappingSystem**: Maps emoji combinations to multiple emotional states with probability scores
3. **EmotionalShiftTracker**: Tracks emotional changes across conversations to detect significant shifts
4. **EmojiResponseGenerator**: Generates emotionally appropriate emoji responses based on detected emotions

- **CulturalContext**: Cultural contexts for adaptation (WESTERN, EASTERN_ASIAN, etc.)
- **ResponseTone**: Possible emotional tones for responses (MATCHING, SUPPORTIVE, NEUTRAL, etc.)

## Expected Inputs/Outputs

### Inputs

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer accepts the following inputs:

1. **Emoji Sequences**: Strings containing one or more emoji characters
   - Example: "üòäüëç", "üò≠üíî", "üò°‚ùó"
   - Can contain text mixed with emojis (only emojis will be analyzed)
   - Empty strings are valid inputs and will be interpreted as neutral

2. **Cultural Context**: Enum values from CulturalContext
   - Used to adapt interpretation and response generation
   - Default is GLOBAL

3. **Response Tone**: Optional enum values from ResponseTone
   - Used to specify the desired emotional tone for responses
   - If not provided, an appropriate tone is automatically determined

### Outputs

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer produces the following outputs:

1. **EmotionalState**: Detailed representation of detected emotions
   - Primary and secondary emotions with probabilities
   - Emotional intensity and confidence scores

2. **Emotional Maps**: Dictionaries mapping multiple emotions to probability scores
   - Used for nuanced emotion understanding
   - Includes related emotions with lower probabilities

3. **EmotionalShift**: Details about detected changes in emotion
   - Magnitude of the shift (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Detected triggers and temporal patterns
   - Only returned when significant shifts occur

4. **EmojiEmotionalResponse**: Generated emoji responses
   - Primary emoji sequence
   - Alternative sequences with different tones
   - Cultural adaptations for different contexts
   - Alignment scores with agent principles

## Relationship to Empire Framework Principles

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer embodies several key Empire Framework principles:

1. **Empathy Through Understanding**: By accurately detecting and responding to emotional content, the analyzer demonstrates the agent's ability to understand and connect with users on an emotional level.

2. **Adaptability as Strength**: The cultural adaptation capabilities and flexible response generation allow the agent to adjust its emotional communication based on context.

3. **Fairness Through Inclusivity**: By supporting multiple cultural contexts and providing alternative responses, the analyzer ensures equitable emotional communication across diverse backgrounds.

4. **Harmony Through Alignment**: The analyzer checks responses against the agent's principles to ensure emotional communication aligns with core values.

5. **Resilience Through Reflection**: The emotional shift tracking enables the agent to recognize changes in user emotional states and adapt accordingly.

### GrowthJournal Integration

The analyzer contributes to the agent's GrowthJournal by recording:

1. Challenging emotional patterns that required adaptation
2. Successful emotional response strategies
3. Emerging cultural patterns in emoji usage
4. Areas where emotion detection confidence could be improved

## Error Handling

The EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

### Error Types

| Error Code | Error Type | Description | Recovery Strategy |
|------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| E001 | ParseError | Failed to parse emoji sequence | Return neutral emotional state |
| E002 | KnowledgeBaseError | Error accessing emoji knowledge base | Fall back to built-in mappings |
| E003 | ContextSwitchError | Failed to switch cultural context | Maintain current context, log warning |
| E004 | PrincipleEngineError | Failed to check principle alignment | Assign default alignment score |
| E005 | HistoryAccessError | Cannot access conversation history | Disable shift detection temporarily |
| E006 | ResponseGenerationError | Failed to generate response | Return safe neutral response |

### Exception Handling

```python
try:
    # Operation that might fail
except EmojiAnalyzerError as e:
    # Log specific error
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e.code} - {e.message}")
    # Apply recovery strategy
    recovery_result = e.apply_recovery_strategy()
    # Continue with degraded functionality
```

### Validation

The analyzer validates inputs using the following strategies:

1. **Emoji Sequence Validation**: Checks for valid Unicode emoji characters
2. **Cultural Context Validation**: Ensures the specified context is supported
3. **Response Tone Validation**: Verifies that requested tones are appropriate for the detected emotion

## Example Usage

### Basic Emotion Detection

```python
from emoji_emotional_analyzer import EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer

# Create analyzer instance
analyzer = EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer()

# Detect emotion in emoji sequence
emotion = analyzer.detect_emotion("üòäüëç")
print(f"Primary emotion: {emotion.primary_emotion.name}")
print(f"Probability: {emotion.primary_probability:.2f}")
print(f"Intensity: {emotion.intensity.name}")
```

### Tracking Emotional Shifts in Conversation

```python
# Track a conversation
analyzer.track_conversation("üòÄ")  # User is happy
analyzer.track_conversation("üëç", is_user_message=False)  # Agent response
analyzer.track_conversation("üòî")  # User is now sad

# Check for emotional shifts
shift = analyzer.detect_emotional_shift()
if shift:
    print(f"Detected shift from {shift.from_state.primary_emotion.name} to {shift.to_state.primary_emotion.name}")
    print(f"Magnitude: {shift.magnitude:.2f}")
    print(f"Trigger: {shift.detected_trigger}")
    print(f"Pattern: {shift.temporal_pattern}")
```

### Generating Emotionally Appropriate Responses

```python
# Generate response to a sad emoji
response = analyzer.generate_response("üò≠")
print(f"Response: {response.emoji_sequence}")
print(f"Intent: {response.emotional_intent}")

# Generate response with specific tone
response = analyzer.generate_response("üòî", desired_tone=ResponseTone.ENCOURAGING)
print(f"Encouraging response: {response.emoji_sequence}")

# Check alternative responses
for alt_seq, alt_intent, alt_score in response.alternative_sequences:
    print(f"Alternative: {alt_seq} ({alt_intent}) - Alignment: {alt_score:.2f}")
```

### Cultural Adaptation

```python
# Adapt to a different cultural context
analyzer.adapt_to_cultural_context(CulturalContext.EASTERN_ASIAN)

# Generate culturally adapted response
response = analyzer.generate_response("üòÄ")
print(f"Eastern Asian response: {response.emoji_sequence}")

# Display all cultural adaptations
for context, adaptation in response.cultural_adaptations.items():
    print(f"{context.name}: {adaptation}")
```

### Working with Principle Alignment

```python
from principle_engine import PrincipleEngine

# Create analyzer with principle engine
principles = PrincipleEngine()
analyzer = EmojiEmotionalAnalyzer(principle_engine=principles)

# Generate and check response alignment
response = analyzer.generate_response("üò°")
print(f"Response: {response.emoji_sequence}")
print(f"Alignment score: {response.principle_alignment_score:.2f}")

# Low alignment triggers alternatives
if response.principle_alignment_score < 0.8 and response.alternative_sequences:
    better_alt = max(response.alternative_sequences, key=lambda x: x[2])
    print(f"Better alternative: {better_alt[0]} - Alignment: {better_alt[2]:.2f}")
```
