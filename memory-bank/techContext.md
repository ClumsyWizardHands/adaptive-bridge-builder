# Technical Context for Adaptive Bridge Builder

## Development Environment

### Programming Language
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Rationale**: Strong support for asynchronous operations, extensive libraries, and cross-platform compatibility

### Framework Dependencies
- **A2A Protocol Library**: Implementation of the Agent-to-Agent Protocol specification
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: For structured communication between agents
- **Cryptography**: For secure message signing and verification
- **Async I/O**: For non-blocking message handling
- **Logging**: For comprehensive audit trails and debugging

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub flow
- **Testing Framework**: PyTest for unit and integration testing
- **Documentation**: Sphinx with Napoleon docstring format
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Code Quality**: Black for formatting, Pylint for linting, MyPy for type checking

## Technical Constraints

### A2A Protocol Compliance
- Must follow all A2A Protocol specifications
- Required to implement the Agent Card standard
- Must support A2A message validation and routing

### Security Requirements
- All communications must be authenticated and encrypted
- Credentials must be securely managed
- Message integrity must be verified

### Performance Targets
- Low latency message processing (< 500ms)
- Efficient memory usage to support high throughput
- Graceful handling of network interruptions

### Deployment Considerations
- Must run in containerized environments (Docker)
- Support for Kubernetes orchestration
- Configuration through environment variables

## Technical Debt Awareness
- The A2A Protocol is evolving, requiring periodic updates
- Initial implementation focuses on core functionality, with extensibility planned for future iterations
- Technical debt will be tracked and addressed in dedicated refactoring cycles

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components (message parsing, validation, routing)
2. **Integration Tests**: For interaction between components
3. **Load Tests**: For performance under various message volumes
4. **Security Tests**: For vulnerability assessment
5. **Compatibility Tests**: With different A2A Protocol implementations
