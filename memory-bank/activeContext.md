## Current Focus: Principles-Based Agent System Enhancements

We have successfully implemented key components of the principles-based agent system and are now focused on enhancing it:

1. **Implemented Components**:
   - Structured JSON format for principles
   - PrincipleEngine as the core evaluation system
   - PrincipleActionEvaluator for evaluating actions against principles
   - PrinciplesIntegration for easy integration into agent systems

2. **Current Enhancement Work**:
   - Created EnhancedPrincipleEvaluator with improved scoring mechanisms
   - Added pattern-based detection for principle violations
   - Building specialized evaluators for different principle types
   - Implementing context-aware evaluations

3. **Testing Progress**:
   - Created test_principles_integration.py for basic functionality testing
   - Developed test_enhanced_principle_evaluator.py for comparing standard and enhanced evaluators

## Current Issues

1. **Inconsistent Scoring**: Testing revealed that our enhanced evaluator sometimes produces unexpected scores:
   - More strict on "good" actions that should be approved (expected behavior)
   - Sometimes more lenient on clear violations depending on context (unexpected behavior)
   - Scoring is working but needs refinement for consistency

2. **Method Implementation Gaps**: Some methods referenced in tests are not fully implemented:
   - Missing explanation generation methods
   - Missing alternative suggestion generation methods
   - Need to complete method implementations to enable thorough testing

3. **Need for Completion**: The EnhancedPrincipleEvaluator has several incomplete methods:
   - `_create_alternative_from_recommendation` is referenced but not implemented
   - Full explanation generation is not working correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Enhanced Evaluator**: Complete implementation of all methods needed for testing
   - Implement explanation generation methods
   - Complete alternative suggestion system
   - Fix method signature issues causing test failures

2. **Improve Pattern Recognition**: Ensure patterns consistently identify problematic actions
   - Add more specialized evaluators for different principle types
   - Fix scoring inconsistencies where clear violations are not properly penalized

3. **Context-Aware Refinements**: Improve how contextual information affects evaluations
   - Emergency situations should allow some flexibility but maintain core principles
   - User consent should appropriately affect evaluation but not override clear violations
   - Create more nuanced handling of effect scope and duration

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Expand tests to validate all improvements
   - Finalize test scripts to verify consistent scoring
   - Create scenario-based tests that mimic real-world usage
   - Document testing results and improvement metrics
