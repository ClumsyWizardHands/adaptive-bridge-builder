# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on building out the Empire Framework's core infrastructure, specifically:

1. **Empire Framework Component System**: Developing a comprehensive component model with well-defined schemas, validation, and registry for managing Ends, Means, Principles, Identities, Resentments, and Emotions.

2. **A2A Protocol Integration**: Implementing the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol for exposing Empire Framework components to external agents, facilitating interoperability in multi-agent systems.

3. **Principle Engine Fairness Extension**: Developing fairness evaluation capabilities for the Principle Engine to detect bias in agent actions.

4. **Emoji Emotional Analyzer**: Enhancing the emoji emotional analysis capabilities with improved documentation and testing.

## Recent Key Decisions

### Empire Framework Core Components
- **Component Schema Architecture**: Created a core schema with type-specific extensions to ensure consistency while allowing specialization.
- **Validation Strategy**: Implemented a robust validation system that can perform both whole-component validation and field-specific validation.
- **Registry Approach**: Designed the ComponentRegistry to support versioning, advanced querying, and relationship traversal.
- **Versioning Model**: Adopted semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all components with automatic patch increments on updates.

### A2A Protocol Integration
- **Adapter Pattern**: Created A2AAdapter class to handle bidirectional conversion between Empire components and A2A message formats.
- **Standardized Endpoints**: Implemented four standardized A2A API endpoints (getComponents, getComponentById, getRelatedComponents, getComponentParts).
- **Granular Access**: Developed component part extraction for fine-grained access to component aspects.
- **Validation During Conversion**: Added optional validation to ensure component integrity during conversion.

### Storage Considerations
- Designed the registry with a pluggable storage architecture to allow for future implementation of different backends.
- For now, using in-memory storage with JSON import/export.

### Configuration Management
- Developed a layered configuration strategy with precedence rules: command line > environment variables > configuration files > defaults.
- Organized components in a clear directory structure under `/resources/`.

## Unresolved Issues
- Storage backend implementation remains to be developed.
- Integration with the existing Principle Engine needs finalization.
- Need to consider scalability for large numbers of components.
- Authentication and authorization for A2A endpoints need to be implemented.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Develop integration tests between validation and registry.
- Implement a file-based storage backend for persistent storage.
- Create a component network visualization tool to help understand relationship graphs.
- Integrate the component system with the Principle Engine.
- Add authentication and access control to A2A endpoints.
