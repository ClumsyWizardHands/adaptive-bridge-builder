# Product Context for Adaptive Bridge Builder

## Problems Being Solved
1. **Interoperability Gaps**: Different agent systems often struggle to communicate effectively due to varying protocols and data formats.
2. **Trust Deficits**: Lack of transparency and predictability in agent-to-agent communications creates barriers to collaboration.
3. **Adaptation Challenges**: Rapidly evolving agent ecosystems require intermediaries that can evolve alongside them.
4. **Communication Breakdowns**: Misinterpretations and message losses between agents lead to system failures.

## User Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**: Users want their various agent systems to work together without manual intervention.
2. **Reliable Communication**: Ensure that messages are delivered accurately and consistently.
3. **Ethical Mediation**: Maintain principled interactions that align with core values.
4. **Transparent Operations**: Understand how and why communication happens between agents.
5. **Adaptive Functionality**: Accommodate changes in agent behaviors and capabilities over time.

## System Expectations
1. **Protocol Adherence**: Strict compliance with A2A Protocol specifications and JSON-RPC 2.0 standards.
2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Message delivery success rate > 99.9%
   - Processing latency < 500ms per message
   - Scalability to handle 1000+ messages per minute
3. **Security Requirements**:
   - End-to-end encryption for all communications
   - Authentication for all connecting agents
   - Audit trail of all message exchanges
4. **Operational Parameters**:
   - 24/7 availability
   - Graceful degradation under load
   - Self-healing capabilities

## Integration Points
1. Various agent systems using the A2A Protocol
2. Monitoring and logging infrastructure
3. Authentication and identity management systems
4. Analytics platforms for performance tracking
