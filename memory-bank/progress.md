# Progress Report

## Completed

### Empire Framework Component Model
- ‚úÖ Defined core component schema (`core_empire_component_schema.json`) with essential fields, relationship modeling, and metadata.
- ‚úÖ Created specialized schemas for all component types:
  - `ends_schema.json`: Goals and outcomes with success metrics and progress tracking
  - `means_schema.json`: Methods, tools, and resources with effectiveness assessments
  - `principles_schema.json`: Values and guidelines with evaluation criteria and adherence examples
  - `identity_schema.json`: Self-perception and beliefs with evolution tracking
  - `resentments_schema.json`: Perceived injustices with impact assessments and resolution strategies
  - `emotions_schema.json`: Affective states with behavioral influences and regulation strategies
- ‚úÖ Implemented schema validation system with:
  - Schema reference resolution and caching for performance
  - Detailed error reporting for validation failures
  - Validation for both individual components and collections

### Empire Framework Registry System
- ‚úÖ Implemented `ComponentRegistry` with:
  - Complete CRUD operations for component management
  - Semantic versioning with auto-incrementation
  - Component archiving vs. hard deletion options
  - Indexing for efficient queries by type, tag, and status
  - Relationship traversal capabilities
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
  - Export/import functionality for persistence
  - Flexible filter-based query system

### A2A Protocol Integration
- ‚úÖ Created `A2AAdapter` class in `src/empire_framework/a2a/a2a_adapter.py` with:
  - Bidirectional conversion between Empire components and A2A messages
  - Component parts extraction for granular access to component aspects
  - Batch operations for efficient multi-component handling
  - Optional validation during conversion to ensure component integrity
- ‚úÖ Implemented A2A API endpoints in `src/api/a2a/handlers.py` with:
  - `empire.getComponents`: Returns components matching specified filters
  - `empire.getComponentById`: Returns a specific component by ID
  - `empire.getRelatedComponents`: Returns components related to a specific component
  - `empire.getComponentParts`: Returns specific parts of a component
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive integration tests in `src/tests/test_a2a_integration.py` covering:
  - Adapter functionality for all conversion operations
  - API handler functionality for all endpoints
  - Error handling and edge cases
- ‚úÖ Documented A2A integration in `docs/empire_a2a_integration.md` with:
  - Architecture overview
  - Message format specifications
  - Usage examples for all endpoints
  - Best practices and implementation considerations

### PrincipleEngine Extensions
- ‚úÖ Implemented fairness evaluation functionality:
  - Added `PrincipleEngineFairness` class with bias detection capabilities
  - Created modular fairness extension approach for simpler integration

### Configuration and Documentation
- ‚úÖ Created detailed configuration plan in `memory-bank/deployment/empire_config_plan.md`
- ‚úÖ Organized schema resources in clear directory structure under `/resources/empire_framework_schemas/`
- ‚úÖ Created example components and validation tests
- ‚úÖ Updated memory bank with active context and progress

## Issues and Resolutions

### Resolved
- ‚úÖ **Schema Structure**: Resolved through a core schema with type-specific extensions to balance consistency and specialization
- ‚úÖ **Version Management**: Addressed with semantic versioning and automatic patch increments
- ‚úÖ **Relationship Modeling**: Solved with bidirectional indexing and typed relationships
- ‚úÖ **Validation Performance**: Fixed with schema caching and optimized validation paths
- ‚úÖ **Component Interoperability**: Solved with A2A adapter for standardized exchange format

### Pending
- ‚ùì **Storage Implementation**: Need to determine best approach for scalable persistent storage
- ‚ùì **Principle Engine Integration**: Need to update Principle Engine to use new component model
- ‚ùì **Component Serialization**: Need to address potential circular references in component relationships
- ‚ùì **Performance Concerns**: Need benchmarks for large numbers of components/relationships
- ‚ùì **A2A Security**: Need to implement authentication and access control for A2A endpoints
