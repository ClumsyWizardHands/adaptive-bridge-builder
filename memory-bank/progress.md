## Recently Completed

1. **Principles-Based Agent System** - We've created a complete implementation that allows agents to evaluate actions against principles, both ethical and strategic. The system features:
   - Plain text to JSON conversion
   - Action evaluation against principles
   - Alternative suggestion generation
   - Simple API for integration with any agent system
   - Context-aware evaluation (e.g., emergency situations)
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples

2. **Test Suite** - Added test_principles_integration.py to demonstrate functionality

3. **Memory Bank Updates** - Kept activeContext.md current with latest focus

## Current Issues

1. **Principle Evaluation Logic** - The evaluation mechanism needs refinement to properly score actions based on principles

2. **Recommendation Quality** - Some recommendations are repetitive and could use more contextual variation

3. **Testing Coverage** - Need more comprehensive tests with different principle sets

## Next Steps

### Short-term
1. Enhance the action evaluation logic in principle_engine_action_evaluator.py
2. Improve recommendation diversity and quality in the alternative generation
3. Create more specialized pattern matching for common principle violations

### Medium-term
1. Integrate the principle system with the LLM adapters for more nuanced reasoning
2. Add learning capabilities to improve evaluation over time
3. Develop a visualization component for principle evaluation results

### Long-term
1. Expand to multi-agent principle negotiation
2. Add distributed principle repository for federated learning
3. Create an interactive training system for customizing principles

## Technical Debt
- Some modules could use refactoring for better code reuse
- Inconsistent parameter naming across different modules
- Need more comprehensive input validation
- Better error handling for edge cases
