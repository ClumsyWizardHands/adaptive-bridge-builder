# Adaptive Bridge Builder

A sophisticated agent framework designed to facilitate communication and collaboration between different AI agent systems using the A2A Protocol.

## Mission Statement

The Adaptive Bridge Builder agent embodies the "Empire of the Adaptive Hero" profile, serving as a connector that adapts to various communication needs while maintaining core principles of fairness, harmony, and adaptability.

## Strategic Goals

1. Enable seamless communication between diverse agent systems
2. Maintain ethical principles throughout all interactions
3. Adapt to changing communication requirements
4. Serve as a trusted intermediary for complex agent ecosystems

## Empire Framework Integration

The Adaptive Bridge Builder is built upon the Empire Framework, a structured approach to agent design that focuses on principled operation and adaptable execution. The framework provides:

### Core Empire Components

- **Ends-Means-Principles (EMP) Structure**: Every action is guided by clear ends (goals), appropriate means (methods), and consistent principles (values)
- **Profile-Based Operation**: The agent embodies the "Empire of the Adaptive Hero" profile, emphasizing adaptability, fairness, and harmony
- **Principle Engine**: Core component that evaluates actions against established principles to ensure ethical operation
- **Growth Journal**: Integrated learning system that records experiences and adaptations for continuous improvement

### Directory Structure

- **memory-bank/**: Central repository for the agent's knowledge and context
  - **activeContext.md**: Current focus and recent decisions
  - **progress.md**: Detailed component status and capabilities
  - **projectbrief.md**: Mission statement and strategic goals

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ClumsyWizardHands/adaptive-bridge-builder.git
cd adaptive-bridge-builder

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from src.adaptive_bridge_builder import AdaptiveBridgeBuilder

# Initialize the bridge builder
bridge = AdaptiveBridgeBuilder()

# Configure with principles
bridge.configure_principles(principles=["fairness", "adaptability", "harmony"])

# Connect to agent systems
bridge.connect(agent_system1)
bridge.connect(agent_system2)

# Start facilitating communication
bridge.start()
```

## Development Status

This project is actively under development. Current focus is on the emoji communication system components, including:

1. EmojiTranslationEngine
2. EmojiGrammarSystem
